# Face Emotion Recognition

This project is a **Face Emotion Recognition System** that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify emotions from images and videos. It is built using **Flask**, **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **MySQL**.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Register and log in using MySQL database.
- **Emotion Detection**: Upload an image or video, and the system detects emotions such as *Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, Disgust,* and *Fear*.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Uses OpenCV to detect faces and TensorFlow for emotion prediction.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays the emotion statistics in a pie chart.
- **Web-based Interface**: Built with Flask and rendered using HTML templates.
